        <p>Conway's Game of Life is a <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cellular_automaton">cellular automaton</a> first described by English mathematician John Conway in 1970. In the Game of Life, cells on a grid are either live or dead. Each turn, the number of live cells around each cell determines whether that cell is alive or dead in the next turn. Thus, the initial state of the grid determines how the game unfolds. In the example on this site, the initial grid is created randomly. The rules determining the state of each cell every turn are as follows (taken from <a href="https://www.conwaylife.com/wiki/Conway%27s_Game_of_Life">LifeWiki</a>):</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Any live cell with fewer than two live neighbours dies</li>
            <li>Any live cell with more than three live neighbours dies</li>
            <li>Any live cell with two or three live neighbours lives, unchanged, to the next generation</li>
            <li>Any dead cell with exactly three live neighbours will come to life</li>
        </ol>
        <p>When Conway began experimenting with the Game, he did not use a computer, instead playing the Game on a Go board and logging his results in a notebook. Over the years, Conway and other mathematicians have discovered all kinds of patterns that can emerge in the game. The Game of Life is often cited as an example of mathematical beauty - and there is indeed something quite mezmerizing about watching the complex patterns that can be generated by a game with such a simple ruleset.</p>
        <p>Aside from creating the Game of Life, Conway was a prolific academic who made contributions to several fields of mathematics. To those interested in computer science, he is also notable for creating the "Doomsday" algorithm for determining the day of the week for any given date. In 2020, Conway died from COVID-19. He was 82 years old.</p>
